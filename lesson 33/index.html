				Earth is the planet we live on; the third from the Sun and the fifth of the largest planets in the solar system. The solar system is believed to have formed from vortex clouds of gas and dust ca. 5 billion years ago. The earth is rich in natural resources, has a generally favorable climate and is possibly the only planet on which life exists.

				The sun, the central body of the solar system, is a hot ball of gas. It is 750 times the mass of all other bodies in the solar system combined. That is why everything in the solar system can be approximately considered revolving around the sun. The Sun "outweighs" the Earth by 330,000 times. A chain of 109 planets like ours could be placed on the solar diameter. The Sun is the closest star to the Earth, it is the only one of the stars, whose visible disk is visible to the naked eye. All other stars that are light-years distant from us, even when viewed through powerful telescopes, do not reveal any details of their surfaces. Light from the Sun reaches us in 8 and a third minutes. According to one of the hypotheses, it was together with the Sun that our planetary system, the Earth, was formed, and then life on it.

				The Milky Way (also our Galaxy or simply the Galaxy with a capital letter) is the galaxy in which the Earth, the Solar System are located. Go to the section "Location of the Sun in the Galaxy" and all the individual stars visible to the naked eye.

				Constellations are areas into which the celestial sphere is divided for ease of orientation in the starry sky. In ancient times, constellations were called characteristic figures formed by bright stars. The most important of them were named by names borrowed from mythology (Hercules, Perseus, etc.) or everyday life (Libra, Lyra, etc.).

				Gravity is the force that pulls two bodies towards each other, the force that makes apples fall to the earth and planets revolve around the sun. The more massive the object, the stronger its gravitational attraction.

			<div>
				The universe consists of galaxies - an interstellar cluster, in one of which we are. It is impossible to discern what is behind the observed universe due to the fact that the light emanating from the stars did not manage to reach us in fourteen billion years (this is the time since the Big Bang, when the universe was formed). <br>
Do not confuse the concept of "universe" and "space" - we have far from fully explored quantum space. Modern telescopes simply cannot find out if there are parallel universes and if it is true that the universe / space is infinite.
